# RICM-learn-to-solder-kit
These badges were designed as a soldering demo for the Rhode Island Computer Museum (RICM). They were designed to teach the basics of thru-hole soldering, as well as to provide users with a take home wearable. Note that the battery clip used in this design is surface mount and considerably more difficult to solder. Depending on the audience it may be desirable for the instructor to solder this component before passing them out. 
 
Goals for this kit are:
A beginner kit for learning to solder.
Simple 2 LED on a battery to learning circuits.
Low cost - suitable for scout troops or school classes. $5-$10 range.

The kit contains:
1x printed circuit board.
1x 47KΩ resistors (1/4W 5% carbon-film)
2x 220Ω resistors (1/4W 5% carbon-film)
1x NPN transistors (2N3904, TO-92-3 Kinked Lead)
2x light-emitting diodes (5mm, any color as desired)
1x battery holder (Keystone 3002, 20mm coin cell, surface mount)
1x CR2032 Battery (3V, 20x3.2mm, 200mA)
